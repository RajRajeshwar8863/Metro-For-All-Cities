All-India Metro Navigator üöá

A powerful and efficient command-line application built in C++ that finds the shortest path between any two metro stations in major Indian cities. This project leverages graph theory and Dijkstra's algorithm to provide users with a fast, interactive, and intuitive navigation tool.

‚ú® Key Features
Multi-City Support: Seamlessly switch between different metro networks, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. The architecture is designed to be easily expandable with new city data.

Shortest Path Calculation: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm from scratch to accurately find the shortest route by distance between any two stations.

Detailed Travel Summary: Provides a clean, color-coded summary of your trip, including:

The complete step-by-step route.

The total number of stations in the path.

The total travel distance in kilometers.

An estimated fare for the journey.

Interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI): A user-friendly, menu-driven interface that makes navigation and input straightforward.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Concepts
Language: C++

Core Concepts: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Data Structures:

Graphs (Adjacency List implementation) to represent the metro network.

Priority Queue (std::priority_queue) to optimize Dijkstra's algorithm.

Hash Maps (std::unordered_map, std::map) for efficient vertex lookups and multi-city management.

Algorithm: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm for route calculation.
