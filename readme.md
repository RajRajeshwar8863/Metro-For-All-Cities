[cite_start]A powerful and efficient command-line application built in C++ that finds the shortest path between any two metro stations in major Indian cities. [cite_start]This project leverages graph theory and Dijkstra's algorithm to provide users with a fast, interactive, and intuitive navigation tool[cite: 1, 2, 3].

## ✨ Key Features



* [cite_start]**Multi-City Support** [cite: 3][cite_start]: Seamlessly switch between different metro networks, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. [cite_start]The architecture is designed to be easily expandable with new city data[cite: 1].

* [cite_start]**Shortest Path Calculation** [cite: 1][cite_start]: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm from scratch to accurately find the shortest route by distance between any two stations.

* [cite_start]**Detailed Travel Summary** [cite: 3][cite_start]: Provides a clean, color-coded summary of your trip, including:

    * [cite_start]The complete step-by-step route.

    * [cite_start]The total number of stations in the path.

    * [cite_start]The total travel distance in kilometers.

    * [cite_start]An estimated fare for the journey.

* [cite_start]**Interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A user-friendly, menu-driven interface that makes navigation and input straightforward.

* **Core Concepts:** **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**

* **Data Structures:**

    * [cite_start]**Graphs** (Adjacency List implementation) to represent the metro network[cite: 2].

    * [cite_start]**Priority Queue** (`std::priority_queue`) to optimize Dijkstra's algorithm[cite: 1].

    * [cite_start]**Hash Maps** (`std::unordered_map`, `std::map`) for efficient vertex lookups and multi-city management[cite: 2, 3].

* [cite_start]**Algorithm:** **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm** for route calculation.
